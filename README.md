# Verilog toUpper

## Kmap 
The kmap was filled in using a python/pandas script in main.py. This scirpt generates a csv file representation of the kmap where the lowercase letters are seperated. This was then imported into google sheets, where I highlighted the letters that would be changed by the function, and then mapped the kmap to be A5 out. I then imported an image of that into a pdf editing file and grouped my kmap as seen below.
